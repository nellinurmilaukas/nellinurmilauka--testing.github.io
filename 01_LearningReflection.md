## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?

    I have previously been part of testing that used cypress. However, I think it was interesting to get hands-on with writing tests.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case?
    The management was done via Jira, and the testing itself was done with Zephyr, where you can write the steps step by step.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management, 
 I found it easy to compile the test cases first into Jira using Zephyr where they can be tested manually. And after that I used Cypress to make automatic tests.


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
 I have used Visual Studio Code

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
 No troubles


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
 I've used github a lot, so there were no problems with it
 

      

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
    I'm already familiar with Cypress, so I recommend it. There you can create automated tests easily, even if you don't have much knowledge of javascript.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 

    I have really enjoyed the course. Even though I have worked with testing, I really learned a lot of new things. I haven't even thought that testing could be such a broad concept.

    I think the content of the course was clearly divided. I really liked that the content also included videos to support learning. However, I would probably have needed more practical tasks and getting to know more about the use of Cypress, for example.

    Thanks for the excellent teaching and study material!
